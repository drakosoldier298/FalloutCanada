## A Fallout TTRPG based in the Canadian wasteland
  
Originally planned to start in Seattle now starts in a vault in Canada. The vault portion is to be setup as a one-shot using the things I make for the rest of the campaign.

THIS IS NOT USING CANON 
Due to the amount of research and annoyances I will be taking creative liberty in a lot of the lore, Canada IS NOT IN THE MAIN GAMES, But I will be overhauling how Canada works to fit what kind of story I want and make it a bit more interesting for players.


A fallout story set in 2193.

  

Fully custom perks, Weapons, Races, Creatures, Locations and even some custom chems
