# anaconda's

 A gang that cropped up in [[locations/Seattle\|Seattle]] in <font color="#f79646">2190</font> ish. 
 They go by the name "anaconda's" because of rumours of the Tunnel snakes reaching the area and They are near a river. 

 Theyre mostly docile and rarely attack on sight. 
They try to sell [[chems/Nukashine\|Nukashine]] any chance they get weather its ready for consumption or not
They steal nukacola any time they can and have tried to make their own unsuccesfully multiple times.
