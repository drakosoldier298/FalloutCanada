# The JT's

Originally a branch of the Canadian military Named Joint Task Force 2 that was an extremely high-readiness and precise special operations forces unit. JTF 2 existed to protect the Canadian national interests and combat terrorism and threats to Canadians at home and abroad. Now act more like a Canadian mix of the Enclave trying to keep the military personnel and ideals alive and the Brotherhood of Steel, with their militaristic hierarchy.
