# Settle

Founded in the late <font color="#f79646">2100</font>'s by settlers moving from california, the city of Settle was founded in the ruins of the old city. 
The city is a medical center and a hub for trade in the area. The city is known for its inclusivity and tries to be a safe haven for ghouls. 
The city is also known for its amusement park built around the great wheel, with as much nukacola memorabilia as they could find. 
The city is also known for its near endless supply of water from the nearby river.

There are a ton of medical stores here. 
They tend to try and keep the brotherhood of steel out of the town but offer help when the brotherhood needs it. 
 - The town is a medical center being able to cure most diseases, cure radiation and tries to be inclusive to ghouls, but racism does occur no matter how hard the local "police" try to stop it.
 - Not too many raiders
 - gangs like the [[faction/anaconda's\|anaconda's]]
