# Seattle
In 2077 when the bombs dropped the Space needle was Nearly destroyed, surviving for the most part with major cosmetic and minor structural damage, in 2100  military silos were activated and nuked Seattle 2 more times on the edges,  The radiation has mostly settled allowing safe passage and Settlers to move in, 

in 2185 Settlers moved in and turned Seattle ,West of the space needle, into a city again, nicknaming it [[locations/settle\|settle]].  They tend to try and keep the brotherhood of steel out of the town but offer help when the brotherhood needs it. 


The [[faction/Brotherhood of steel\|Brotherhood of steel]] Wanders seattle in search of relics of the past, they have a base in the space needle, as they do repairs and are working on turning the surrounding area into a town Nicknamed [[locations/cascadia\|Cascadia]]

The surroundings of the destroyed city have started being taken over by wildlife again with trees and radstags returning the most, as well as geckos migrating from the mojave and california
Oddly Mothmen have also started being sighted across the area, No attacks have been reported however. Rumours have it that these arent the same mothman from before the great war but just mutated Moths.
